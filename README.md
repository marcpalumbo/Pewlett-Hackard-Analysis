# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
In this module, we were tasked with creating a functioning database for a fictional company callled Pewlett-Hackard. This fictional company found themselves in a postion where all of their employee data was stored in csv files and multiple speadsheets. Using this data we were able to create an ERD model to conceptualize a database using SQL and build that database to eventually gather insights so that they can prepare for turnover and the upcoming wave of new employees that will be eligible for a mentorship program. 

## Results

There are four major takeaways from the two deliverables of this challenge:


## Number of Employeees Retiring Employees by Title

* There are over 72,000 employees that are scheduled for retirement in the upcoming year
* Of that staggering number of upcoming retirements, over 2/3's of them are either senior engineers or senior staff. 

It would be in the best interest of Pewlett-Hackard to prepare for this in a suitable way in order to avoid a huge lack of working capital in a very important part of their workforce. 

## Employees Eligible for Mentorship Program


* There are only 1,549 employees eligible for the memborship program based on the critirea given. The current criteria is current employees that were born in 1965. 
* The company should consider a couple of things:
  * Should we expand the criteria for mentorship eligibility?
  * Should we mass hire to fill in the gaps?
  
## Summary
Keep in mind that the results of the mentorship eligibility table does not have any regard of title, so of those 1,549 eligible, we are uncertain without further queries and investigating where those employees would be able to step in.The company seems to have put themselves in bad position if they are looking to maintain their workforce manpower.Pewlett-Hackard has some major personnel decisions to make in this upcoming year. They have a considerable amount of senior staff and engineers that are due to retire, while they don't a sustainable amount of those eligible from mentorship to take their place. It is a good thing they decided to consult data professionals to gather this information for them, as they would have been in a bad place had they entered the next year unprepared.
